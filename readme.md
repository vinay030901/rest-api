# REST API

- I have created a rest api using flask microframework.
- This is a shopping api, so we can input shops, items and their related tags in it.
- Shops and items will have their own unique id from which we can access them.
- Moreover, we can use methods like get, post, update and delete.
- To increase the privacy, I have added the register, login and logout functionality.
- It uses flask_smorest, flask_blueprint, jwt etc.
- It is deployed on render.com and uses elephantSQL.
- Whenever we register, mailgun will send the mail to email address.
